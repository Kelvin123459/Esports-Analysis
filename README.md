## What are eSports?

Esports refers to a relatively new class of spectator entertainment in which video game players compete against each other in a specific game. Esports mimics the same concept of traditional sports in most of its aspects (broadcasters, teams, live-viewings, arenas, etc). The genre started development amidst 1990s, however, it was not after 2010 that it began getting major recognition. 

eSports today forms part of a multimillion dollar industry, with thousands of players dispersed over hundreds of games.

However, there is one undeniable aspect that exists: its profitability.
